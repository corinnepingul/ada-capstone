###Corinne's Product Plan:

1. _Problem Statement_: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve.
  - My project will allow users to create their own personal web-based timeline of memories and photos that they can search and access. It will allow people to keep track of small moments throughout their lives that they want to hold onto.
  - The user will be able to send the web-app these moments via sms test messages and mms photo messages where they will be able to include hashtags for grouping and searching their moments
  - The moments will be displayed on the web-application in the form of a visual timeline that is also searchable and editable

2. _Market Research_: Outline the key insights from your research, incuding:
  - your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions)
    - Day One (http://dayoneapp.com/) is the most similar application I have found other than widely popular applications like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter
  - research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
  - differentiation: what makes your idea/product different
    - My application will differ from One Day in that:
      - it will be free
      - it will use text message as the primary way of adding new moments to the timeline (instead of as a mobile app). This will allow even "dumb" phone users to use my app
      - it will not include a lot of the features that One Day does (trying to simplify functionality and user experience)
    - My application will differ from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram in that:
      - it will be private
      - it will have the option of sharing with people or keeping the messages private

3. _User Personas_: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?
  - My main target are people who are too busy to scrapbook, but who still want a way to easily keep track of the small things that happen in their lives that they want to remember
  - Because I want to make it really easy to use out and about even if you don't have a smart phone, I will use text messaging as the primary way to add moments to your timeline.
  - I also imagine my users to be people who don't always want to share the content that they want to keep track of...so this is a good alternative to social media sites, but will also allow for sharing if that is important to the user.

4. _Technologies_

###Week One and Two (what I accomplished):
  - Trello Board complete
  - ERD
  - rails app setup (models made, migrations and seed data set)
  - practice twilio app

###Plan for next week:
